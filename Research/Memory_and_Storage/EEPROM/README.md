# Project Ideas

Start out with reading and writing simple data on a breadboard.


Want to make a [drive from VOTV](https://voicesofthevoid.wiki.gg/wiki/Drive). 
This would contain information like a file name, signal level and possible the audio data itself.
Would also want to add RGB LEDs, a battery and possibly look at board edge connectors.
