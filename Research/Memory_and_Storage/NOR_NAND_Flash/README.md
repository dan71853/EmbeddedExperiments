# Initial Research

[NOR Flash](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/NOR-flash-memory) article.
As the name implies, NOR Flash uses NOR gates, NAND Flash uses NAND gates.

NOR is faster to read but slower to write. NAND has a higher capacity. 

Because NAND Flash is a much higher density, its hard to find in small packages. It doesn't usually use SPI so the pin density it often quite high.

# Options to Buy
[NOR FLASH GD25Q32](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-GD25Q32.html?g=y&SearchText=GD25Q32&selectedSwitches=filterCode%3Achoice_atm)

Can't find any small NAND Flash, so will not get any.
