# Initial Research

The [initial research](./Initial_Research.md) was focused on a motor suited for the [VOTV Drive](../../../Projects/VOTV%20Drive/README.md) project.

# Stepper Motor Testing

Here is some notes on testing the [Pancake Stepper Motor (SP-35RC-810S)](./Pancake_Stepper_Motor_(SP-35RC-810S).md). 

I plan on making a basic full step stepper driver using logic gates. This starts with a low frequency clock which will be made using a 555 timer, here are the notes on the [555 Timer](./555Timer.md).

The next step is to make a 2 bit binary counter, notes on the counter can be found [here](./2BitRippleCounter.md)
