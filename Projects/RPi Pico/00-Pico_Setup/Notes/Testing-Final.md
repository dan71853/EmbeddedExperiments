# Final Testing Document

## LED Blink
### Description 
The [blink.c](../Code/blink/blink.c) code is uploaded to a Pico 2W using a second pico as a debugger.
The code should toggle the onboard LED at a frequency of 1Hz.

### Results
A video can be found [here](./Testing_Images/LED_Blink-Blink_Video.mp4). This shows the LED blinking at the correct frequency.

Here is an image showing both picos, the right pico is the Pico 1 acting as the debugger.
The left pico is the pico 2W which is blinking the onboard LED.

This is all working correctly.
