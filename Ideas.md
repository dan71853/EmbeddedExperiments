# Ideas

This is a collection of ideas, it will have a brief discusion on each new idea. When the idea gets big enough to be made into a project, a folder will be created where the project will continue.

Note the question on this page are not final and can be changed when a project is started. The questions will only be updated in the respective projects page.

A link to the project will be added at the top of the idea in this document.

## Architecture
<!-- ### RISC-V, ARM, instruction sets -->
### State Machines
### RISC-V
## Communication
<!-- ### Serial, RF, CAN, wireless protocols -->

## Displays & UI
<!-- ### LCDs, OLEDs, LED matrices -->
### Displays


## Hardware Interfaces
<!-- ### IÂ²C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC, etc. -->

## Memory and Storage
<!-- ### EEPROM, flash, RAM -->
### EEPROM
See [EEPROM](Projects/Memory_and_Storage/EEPROM/README.md) for the project.

- Why use EEPROM?
  - When is EEPROM better?
- How to access the storage?
  - What hardware communication is used?
  - Is the data just raw memory or can there be structure/directories?
  - What is the speed?
  - Is there any timing requirements?
- Is this different to internal memory on an microcontroller?
- How to check data integrity 
  
## Power & Analog
<!-- ### Voltage regulation, battery power, analog signals -->

## Sensors & Inputs
<!-- ### Buttons, switches, temperature sensors, etc. -->

## Actuators & Outputs
<!-- ### Motors, servos, LEDs, buzzers -->

### Motors

## Timing & Scheduling
<!-- ### Timers, delays, debouncing, real-time tasks -->
